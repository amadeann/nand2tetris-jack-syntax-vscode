## Features

Syntax highlighting for Jack language used in [Nand2Tetris part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2/) course at Coursera. 

![demo](images/demo.png)

The extension currently supports highlighting of:
- all language keywords
- quoted strings 
- comments. 
- type declarations (both keywords and classes)

Jack language is introduced in the 2nd part of the course. If you're taking the first part of the course - [Nand2Tetris part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer), you should check out the HDL language syntax highlighting extension by Rob Lourens: [Nand2Tetris-HDL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=roblourens.vscode-nand2tetris-hdl).
